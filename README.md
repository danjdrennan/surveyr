# Surveyr

An R package for working with survey data.

## Intended Use

The package is intended for use in an education setting working with survey data.
It provides tools for computing statistics from surveys using simple random
sampling, stratified, and clustered surveying designs.
Plotting is simplified with a thin wrapper on ggplot2 functions, enabling a user
to easily create aesthetic graphs.
Examples of generating samples are also made available.


## Installation

Installation should be done via `devtools` in R.
Run the following code to install via GitHub.

```{r}
devtools::install_github("danjdrennan/surveyr")
```


## TODO

* Implement functions for computing mean, variance, and standard errors

* Implement functions to work with various designs

* Document code using Roxygen
