The goal of surveyr is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of surveyr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("danjdrennan/surveyr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(surveyr)
# Make a synthetic dataset for now
set.seed(1)
d <- tibble::tibble(
    region = rep(1:5, 10),
    y = rnorm(50, 50*region, 5*sqrt(region))
)
N <- rpois(5, 50)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r data_summaries}
d %>% make_summary(region, y, N)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plot_data, echo=FALSE}
d %>% s_plot(y, region, kind="hist")
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
